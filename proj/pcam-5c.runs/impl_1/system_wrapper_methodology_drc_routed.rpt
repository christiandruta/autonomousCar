TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 0.983 ns between dphy_data_hs_p[1] (clocked by dphy_hs_clock_p) and system_i/MIPI_D_PHY_RX_0/U0/DataLaneGen[1].DPHY_LaneSFEN_X/HSDeserializerX/Deserializer/DDLY (clocked by dphy_hs_clock_p) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -1.070 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#2 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 0.996 ns between dphy_data_hs_p[0] (clocked by dphy_hs_clock_p) and system_i/MIPI_D_PHY_RX_0/U0/DataLaneGen[0].DPHY_LaneSFEN_X/HSDeserializerX/Deserializer/DDLY (clocked by dphy_hs_clock_p) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -1.028 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning

Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.421 ns between dphy_data_hs_n[0] (clocked by dphy_hs_clock_p) and system_i/MIPI_D_PHY_RX_0/U0/DataLaneGen[0].DPHY_LaneSFEN_X/HSDeserializerX/Deserializer/DDLY (clocked by dphy_hs_clock_p).

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '9' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
